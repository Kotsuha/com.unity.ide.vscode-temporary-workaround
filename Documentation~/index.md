# Code Editor Package for Visual Studio Code

The Visual Studio Code Editor package provides support for Unity-specific features in Visual Studio Code.

This package is no longer supported. It remains accessible in the Unity registry but will receive no updates and functionality isn't guaranteed. For more information, see the [Update on the Visual Studio Code package](https://forum.unity.com/threads/update-on-the-visual-studio-code-package.1302621/) post on the Unity forums.
